# Forest-Cover-Type-Classification
The Forest Cover Type Classification project applies machine learning to predict seven types of forest cover using the Covertype dataset. With 54 cartographic and environmental features, models like Random Forest and XGBoost are trained, evaluated, and compared. Results highlight key factors for ecological monitoring and land management decisions.
