# Forest Cover Type Classification ðŸŒ²

## Description
This project predicts the type of forest cover using cartographic and environmental features from the [Covertype Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/forest-cover-type-dataset).  
We apply tree-based models (Random Forest, XGBoost), evaluate them with confusion matrices, and visualize feature importance.

## Dataset
- Kaggle: [Forest Cover Type Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/forest-cover-type-dataset)
- UCI: [Covertype Data](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/covertype)
